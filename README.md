Welcome to the **Agents AI Store**. This repository is a premium ecosystem of specialized AI capabilities designed to transform large language models (LLMs) into world-class software engineers across multiple domains.

---

## 🚀 The Mission

This project bridges the gap between general-purpose AI and **specialized engineering authority**. Every "Skill" and "Instruction" in this store is not just a prompt; it is a full **System Protocol** that enforces:
- **Architectural Integrity**: Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation).
- **Vertical Slicing**: Modular features that are self-contained and scalable.
- **Performance Excellence**: Core Web Vitals, 60/120 FPS, and minimal bundle sizes.
- **Security-First Development**: Biometrics, secure storage, and token management.

## 🏛️ Strict Architectural Scaffolding

This store follows a **Zero Tolerance** policy for poor architecture. All instructions are hard-coded to enforce a specific scaffolding pattern based on the technology:

### Web Ecosystem (Angular, React, Next.js, NestJS)
Features are organized into **Vertical Slices** with nested **Clean Architecture** layers:
```text
/features/[name]/
├── domain/         # Entities & Repository Interfaces
├── application/    # Use Cases & Mappers
├── infrastructure/ # Repository Implementations & Data Sources
└── presentation/   # Components, Signals/Stores, & Views
```

### Flutter Ecosystem
Features follow the **Tripartite Pattern**:
```text
lib/features/[name]/
├── domain/         # Entities & Interfaces
├── data/           # DTOs, Mappers & Implementations
└── presentation/   # Widgets & Controllers
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

Integrate these expert-level engineering standards into any project in seconds.

### 1. Download the Synchronizer
Run this command in the root of your project:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiegoVilla27/agents-ai-store/main/async_agents.sh && chmod +x async_agents.sh
```

### 2. Synchronize Assets
Sync everything (Skills + Instructions) with one command:
```bash
./async_agents.sh
```

### 3. Start Coding
Once the `.agents/` folder is created, your AI agent (Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) will automatically adopt the professional standards documented in the store.## 📂 Project Structure

## 🤖 Expert Personas (Agents)

Agents are high-level blueprints that combine specific instructions and skills to create a domain expert. Syncing an agent automatically downloads all its dependencies.

| Agent Persona | Mission | Configuration |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `angular-agent` | Senior Master in Signals and Zoneless architecture. | [JSON](./.agents/angular/agents/angular-agent.json) |
| `react-agent` | Master in React 19, Server Components, and State. | [JSON](./.agents/react/agents/react-agent.json) |
| `nextjs-agent` | Full-stack Next.js Specialist (App Router & Actions). | [JSON](./.agents/nextjs/agents/nextjs-agent.json) |
| `react-native-agent` | Mobile Engineer specialized in Expo and Performance. | [JSON](./.agents/react-native/agents/react-native-agent.json) |
| `flutter-agent` | Senior Flutter Architect (Riverpod & Security). | [JSON](./.agents/flutter/agents/flutter-agent.json) |
| `nestjs-agent` | Master of Backend Scalability and Clean Architecture. | [JSON](./.agents/nestjs/agents/nestjs-agent.json) |

### 🛠 How to Activate an Agent
Once synchronized, you can activate a specific persona in your AI chat (Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) using one of these methods:

1. **Explicit Identification**: Mention the agent name in your first prompt:
   > *"Act as the **nextjs-agent**. Let's build a new feature."*
2. **Implicit Detection**: The AI automatically reads the `.agents/` folder and adopts the instructions and skills present in your workspace.
3. **Role Matching**: If you work in a project with a specific `agent.json`, the AI will align its behavior with the `"role"` defined in that blueprint.

## 📜 Strategic Development Instructions

This repository implements **Automatic System Protocols** through specialized instruction files. When an AI agent (like Antigravity) enters a workspace with these files, it automatically adopts the following high-level engineering standards:

| Framework | Instruction Name | Protocol Path | Architectural Pillars |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Angular** | `angular-coding` | [INSTRUCTION.md](./.agents/angular/instructions/angular-coding/INSTRUCTION.md) | Signals, `@defer`, Zoneless, Barrels. |
| **React** | `react-coding` | [INSTRUCTION.md](./.agents/react/instructions/react-coding/INSTRUCTION.md) | React 19, Compiler, Zustand, Index Pattern. |
| **Flutter** | `flutter-coding` | [INSTRUCTION.md](./.agents/flutter/instructions/flutter-coding/INSTRUCTION.md) | Snake_case, Riverpod, No-Index Barrels. |
| **Next.js** | `nextjs-coding` | [INSTRUCTION.md](./.agents/nextjs/instructions/nextjs-coding/INSTRUCTION.md) | App Router, Server Actions, Private Folders. |
| **React Native** | `react-native-coding` | [INSTRUCTION.md](./.agents/react-native/instructions/react-native-coding/INSTRUCTION.md) | **Styled Components**, Expo, FlatList Opt. |
| **NestJS** | `nestjs-coding` | [INSTRUCTION.md](./.agents/nestjs/instructions/nestjs-coding/INSTRUCTION.md) | Clean Architecture, DDD, Zod, Layers. |

## 🏛️ Global Architectural Standards

Every framework in this store is governed by two uncompromising architectural rules:

1.  **Modular Architecture (Vertical Slicing)**: We do not organize by "type" (all components in one folder, all hooks in another). We organize by **feature**. Each feature folder is a self-contained module containing its own components, hooks, validations, and data models.
2.  **Index Pattern (Clean Imports)**: We use `index.ts/tsx` files (except in Flutter) to expose the public API of a module. This ensures that imports are clean, professional, and decoupled from the internal file structure.
